# Scraping Onions
    because sometimes, going to the actual website is just too hard.
    
* Basics
  - At it's most basic, this is a fullstack webscraping app that utilizes various technologies (listed below) to scrape articles from a third party website and display the information.  You can leave a comment, read comments left by others, delete comments, and both save and delete the articles themselves from the database.  
  - At it's most fun, this is an app to read satire and leave salty comments, read salty comments, and delete comments that are simply too salty.  You can even save your scraped onions to read another time, because onions are always best a day old, amirite?
